CAVE is the Conversational Architecture Visual Expression language.  This is the code for the web site that is hosted at [cavelanguage.org](http://cavelanguage.org).

CAVE is a visual design language created to describe contextual applications.  A contextual application is one that dynamically responds to user context, such as their personality, affinity, goals and environment.

CAVE describes the data used to understand user context and its origins, how user context is inferred from raw data, and how an application responds to that context.

We're looking for feedback!
